          <p>
            Kristen and Jason met on a fine summer's eve in June of 2011 at
            Amy's Ice Creams in Austin. He had just graduated and started work,
            and she was just about to finish her master's and graduate. Innocent
            Kristen had no idea what she was in for as Jason began to pursue her
            in as Godly a fashion as he could muster. They started dating on
            July 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2011, and long story short, he proposed on December
            10<sup>th</sup>,
            2012.
          </p>

          <p>
            Their relationship has always been about trying to glorify God
            through his Son Jesus, and they're both so excited to be able to
            celebrate their marriage, a picture of that love, with friends and
            family alike come Saturday, June 1<sup>st</sup>, 2013!

              her. But, when they started working weddings out at camp that

              hardest workers and most determined women out there. Kristen is so

              of Jason's and Kristen's relationship. Getting married without her
